# Day 16: Interview Questions — Data Leakage and Preprocessing Pipelines

## Beginner questions

### Q1. What is data leakage and preprocessing pipelines?
**Answer:** Data leakage happens when information unavailable at prediction time, or information from validation/test data, influences model training or evaluation.

### Q2. Why is it important in an ML workflow?
**Answer:** It improves the reliability of data preparation, training or evaluation. Leakage creates falsely optimistic metrics and production failure. Audit when every feature becomes available and split data before fitting transformations.

### Q3. What syntax or method would you use?
**Answer:** Fit imputation, scaling, encoding and feature selection only on training folds. Use sklearn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer so transformations are fitted and applied consistently. I would explain the input, parameters, output and validation rather than reciting a function name.

## Practical questions

### Q4. How do you know the operation worked correctly?
**Answer:** Test a small known example, compare expected and actual output, inspect boundary cases and verify that the result still makes sense in the business domain.

### Q5. What beginner mistake should you avoid?
**Answer:** Applying a technique without checking assumptions or the meaning of the data. I would inspect source definitions, data types, units, missingness and output before using it downstream.

## Scenario-based interview questions

### Q6. A hospital model predicts readmission at discharge but uses a field entered after readmission. Offline metrics look excellent, but the feature cannot exist when a real prediction is made.
**Answer:** I would first clarify the business goal and gather examples of the issue. Then I would inspect source data, assumptions and the point in time at which each field becomes available. I would reproduce the problem on a small sample, test likely causes one at a time, select a correction based on evidence and validate it on held-out data. I would document limitations and monitor the outcome after release.

### Q7. The aggregate metric is acceptable, but one important customer segment performs poorly. What do you do?
**Answer:** I would calculate metrics and inspect data quality by segment, verify sample sizes, investigate whether the segment differs in behaviour or data capture, and discuss the error trade-off with the business owner. I would not hide the issue behind an overall average.

### Q8. A teammate suggests an immediate fix without investigating the cause. How do you respond?
**Answer:** I would ask for evidence and reproduce the failure. A quick change can mask the root cause or create a new defect. I would compare hypotheses, make the smallest safe change and add a regression test.

## Senior developer questions

### Q9. How do you choose between a simple and complex solution?
**Answer:** Compare correctness, maintainability, latency, cost, explainability, data requirements and operational risk. Start with a baseline and add complexity only when repeatable validation and business impact justify it.

### Q10. What would you monitor after deployment?
**Answer:** Input quality, missing and unknown values, output distributions, latency, errors, delayed ground-truth metrics and segment-level outcomes. Define owners and alert thresholds before release.
